	<h1>Pants</h1>
	<p>Pants are weird. I started writing about dresses, but I realized I don't wear them. They look weird too, but I thought I'd stick to someting I know best.</p>
	<p>Come to think of it, I don't know that much about pants either. I mean, I wear them, but I have no idea who made them. I mean, I do know who (there's a label) but not <strong>who</strong>.</p>
	<p>That made no sense.</p>
	<p>I have bad spelling and grammar.</p>
	<p>If someone made my pants, it's a person who probably wore a name tag. And there were probably more than one person involved. Or a really, really, really super talented person, but that's not who makes cheap jeans.</p>
	<p>My jeans aren't environmentally friendly. I feel bad about that but I didn't pick them; they were a gift. I mean, I don't know for a <strong>fact</strong> that they're environmentally unfriendly, but I'm pretty sure they are. They're made by a famous person who didn't actually make them.</p>
	<p>I'm tired of talking about pants.</p>
