	<h1>&quot;A&quot; is a word</h1>
	<p><strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is an awesome word because it's only a letter that's also a word. </p>
	<p>I don't think a space can be a word, or if it can be, it's not an understandable word. A dot can be a word if there are three in a row like &quot;&hellip;&quot;, but then you need three (3) of the same. This makes <strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> still awesome because it can be a word on its own, although &quot;&hellip;&quot; is a still pretty cool word too. Come to think of it &quot;&hellip;&quot; isn't a word so disregard everything you read about it here.</p>
	<p><strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is the only word I know of that's also a letter, besides <strong>&quot;I&quot;</strong> which I also like. In languages other than English, and there are lots of them out there, there are probably many other letters that are also words. But I don't know how many of them are as easy to write as <strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong>. Or how many of them mean &quot;one of something&quot;.</p>
	<p><strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is also the only word I know that's also a letter that needs another word to describe it that has itself in the writing: <strong>&quot;An&quot;</strong> followed by <strong>&quot;a&quot;</strong>. As in &quot;<strong>an</strong> 'A' is <strong>a</strong> word&quot;. That's pretty awesome too. You get to describe yourself using something with you in the reference twice!</p>
	<p>I think maybe researchers and scientists that use themselves as references probably feel like the word <strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong>. They probably feel other things too like hunger and cramps.</p>
	<p><strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is such an awesome word, that I was only able to write one sentence on this page without it. Can you spot which one it is?</p>
	<small>(Some people think <strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is actually not a word, but I like to think that it is.)</small>
