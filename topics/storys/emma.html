	<h1>Emma</h1>
	<p>Running. Running away. I must keep running. If I don’t, he’ll catch me. I turned right into a dark alley a few blocks after the convenient store. There were some overflowing garbage tins, fill and surrounded by black bags of old wood scraps. It was about 1:27 am, and it was almost pitch black, besides the occasional police car, and run-down, rusted streetlights. The little ball of fur in my pocket, very warm. The Man was in a coat. He was in a black trench coat, a mask, and a hat. I saw a tattoo on his ankle I had never noticed before, in a red ink. It was a weird design, never have I seen anything like it. It resembled a moon, and some strange occultic lettering on top of it. But let's go to the beginning, where my life started as a child, turned into an outcast, and now, a runaway.</p>
	<p>I was about four or five, when I met my first cat. It spoke to me, and I became friends with it. Nobody believed me, not even my parents. As I grew up, all sorts of animals would strike conversation with me. I can fluently talk to all animals. I can also become any animal. I can also call them, summon them, possess them, imitate them, gather information by their senses, and they aren’t bothered by my presences by the slightest. I don’t know why. I also have heightened senses. It went like this for two years, until I was seven. Then he showed up. The man.</p>
	<p>My mother fell madly in love, and he entertained it for a while. I knew he was faking it. But then my mother fell extremely ill, with an unknown illness. She died, and I went into custody of my grandmother. She tried to comfort me, so she bought me a cat. He was small, an orange tabby with a black patch of fur around one eye. The Man came to visit often. I didn’t talk to him, but everybody in my life was seduced by his charm. Then he came for me. He would watch me through my window, follow me too school. Then he came into my room. That’s when I had it. I was done. I ran away, with my cat, phone, my life savings, food, and some clothes. The only person I told was my grandmother, and she said she understood. He kept following me. And that is how I am where I am right now. Freezing In a dark alley behind a bunch of garbage cans, a kitten in my pocket, and my phone.</p>
	<p>The smell reminded me of when I was little, because my family went to a camping park, and it always smelled like fresh cedar, with green grass and trees, and a waterfall with a swimming hole nearby. The water was such a deep blue color, and was so nice to swim in. It felt like I slipped into a nice empty space of clear, blue, cool water. I would always fall asleep to the sound of rushing water. I keep getting text messages, so I turn off my notifications. Then, I fell asleep; Until I heard loud footsteps anyways.</p>
	<p>I thought I had heard footsteps, and so I jolted awake. I looked around, but there was nobody. So, I guessed it was a figure of my imagination. I check my phone. 6:34. I took Mango out and gave him some tuna. He ate it and was very happy afterwards. I check my messages, and Abby texted me. So did Axel and Cruz. I don’t want to ignore them, but I have to, otherwise the police can track me, and He can. I pack up everything, and I start walking down the street. I pulled my hoodie over my head. Abby gave it to me as a gift for my birthday last week. It was a light blue Nike hoodie, and I loved it. I was just walking, then a boy ran into me. I fell back, and he was so shocked. It was as if he didn’t see me at all. Mango luckily was on the other side. He would have died if he encountered him. The boy had messy, blonde hair with black roots, a red shirt with the Nike signs on it, and black shorts. His friends were behind him now, and he snapped out of the trans of staring at me on the floor. His friends were an assortment of kids. They all had dirty clothes but looked like they were trying to stay clean.</p>
	<p>“Say sorry Nate!,” chimed in a taller boy, with straight hair. There was a total of five of them. Nate began apologizing profusely. I said it was fine. He saw I had a couple of minor injuries, and offered to take care of them, I said its fine, but he insisted. So, we went to their house. They called it a base. It was an older home, abandoned home, that was solar powered, and had well water in the middle of the nearby forest. The smell was a fresh, clean. Then we went inside, it was rather well put together, and all of the furnishings were still in great shape. Three boys went out to finds stuff to bring back, and two were left behind to tend to my wounds. It was Nate, and the tall boy, whose name is Jonathan. They explained that there was a little kid in the room farthest down the hallway, who was Nate’s little brother. He is five. They left because a gang of thugs destroyed their home when the little boy was only one. His name is Zeke. They told me to lie down for a while, so I did, and drifted off to sleep, to the sound of rushing water.</p>
	<p>I woke up at 10:23. When I did wake up, I saw Zeke, playing with a green car. I check my phone, and they texted again. They were all was worried about me. When I put it back down, Zeke was standing there. He waved me over to him. I walked over because he might have needed something. I looked for the boys, but I guess they went out. So, I sat down, and he whispered in my ear, "do you want to play with me?” I said yes, and he ran to his room. When he came back, he had a bucket full of cars and trucks and tracks for them. “Do you like trucks?” He replied whispering again, “yeah, I love them. Especially the green ones.” I helped him set them up, and we played with them. Within an hour, we were both laughing, talking; he wasn’t whispering anymore. Right when we were building a big ramp for a green race car, Nate and Jonathan came through the door. Zeke was babbling about how it was going to be a really fast ramp, and I was agreeing, entertaining his fantasies, Nate and Jonathan were standing there, astonished. I didn’t realize until I looked up. “What's wrong?” they stood, then replied, “he has never talked before.” I shot a look of shock at Zeke, then I looked back at Nate. He was crying, just simply, quietly crying. He ran over to his brother and hugged him. Zeke just laughed and giggled; they were both so happy. But the only thing I could think about was ‘why me?’ I don’t know why he talked to me, but he did. They brought back, food, and clothes.</p>
	<p>After I helped Zeke clean up his toys, they started asking me questions. Nate asked most of them. “What's your name, and how old are you?” I replied, “I'm sixteen, and my name is Apollo.” Zeke popped in, “what’s your favorite color?” I picked him up and put him on my lap, and said, “Light, Light blue, like this sweatshirt.” He smiled and hugged me. It took me by surprise, but then I hugged back. Then Nate, joined in, and then Jonathan. Then I asked them their ages. They were both 17. Jonathan older by four months. They asked why I was here, in a forest in the middle of Japan. I replied, “because you wanted to bring me here, and because I ran away, from a very strange man.” then Mango pawed at my jacket pocket. I took him out, and Zeke, Nate, and Jonathan were very surprised. I thought the realized earlier. Zeke was very happy, and I handed him the kitten. “I want some fresh air, so I'll be outside.” I walked out the door, then walked past an old fountain. I didn’t realize how big this house was. I walked through the trees, following the faint sound of water, like a distant no service sound. A tiny little swish. I continued until I saw a clearing, and on the other side of it, about 10 yards away, there it was. The waterfall.</p>
	<p>I did this for two weeks I would sit at the edge of this one brown, smooth enough rock, but not to smooth, so I had some grip and would be less likely to fall. One day, I was right before the clearing, and I felt somebody grab my hand, twist me around, and next thing I know, my lips are pressed against Nate’s. I was shocked, but then calmed down. The atmosphere got a lighter, warmer tone to it, though the clouds were blocking the sun. Then we stopped. He explained how that was his ‘true’ apology. I giggled at that, and we went back home instead of the waterfall. When we got home, Jonathan had taken Zeke out for a trip, so the house was completely empty. I asked what we should do, and he said he wanted to know more about me, so I told him everything. Including the fact that I can turn into any animal and understand them. Then we sat on the couch and fell asleep together.</p>
    <h1>About 2 Years Earlier</h1>
    <p>“Okay class, today you will be wiring the sensors to your robot. You will have 6 yards of copper wire, 3 9-volt batteries, and your choice of proximity, temperature, ultrasonic, or pressure sensors. Make sure you finish your frame if you didn’t yesterday and turn in your original design plan if you haven’t yet. And Apollo, can you come here please?” I shifted my attention from my project to Mr. Bennett. He is my favorite teacher. He covers my art, technology, and engineering blocks. I walk up to his desk, and he walked us over to the old teacher student meeting room, but it isn't used for that anymore, it is usually for the kids who don’t like the classroom because it's too loud.</p>
    <p>As I walk in, he pulls out a folder. Its thick and a little worn, with papers inside. When he opens it, I realize what it is. He keeps separate folders of students' individual elective work. “I wanted to ask you to do a special assignment.” He says in his usual kind voice. “Well, what is it Mr. Bennett?” He looked pleased and started to smile. “I wanted you to make a new device. Like what we sketched last year.” I was minorly excited. I knew exactly what project he was talking about. We had to sketch a futuristic device that serves a functional purpose. I sketched a little microchip that I call Super. You input it into a phone, and it rewrites the restriction module on the device. I was super into technology. “Yeah, I can try.” He gets up swiftly and walk to the closet, pulls out a big box. He hands it to me, and a separate, smaller folder too. It was kind of thick for its size. “Come in whenever you like, you will get lunch in here every day, and if you feel like you need more passes, come see me.” Passes? What does he mean passes? Then I opened the smaller folder, and I was astonished. I realized what he meant by passes now.</p>
    <p>In our school, the teachers can give class skips, where you don’t have to attend a class if you show it to your teacher, and you are free to go wherever you want, including off campus. There is too many to count on one hand. Only Z-ranked teachers can give these passes. And only to the qualifying students. Only six out of all 134 teachers in Skyline Prep. And the qualifications are almost impossible to live up to, because the teachers make it really hard. The qualifications that are necessary for the basics are a perfect attendance record, and at least 9 out of 10 classes have to have 100% maintained in them for 6 months. I looked inside the box, and there were a lot of technology parts, including wires, a chip base, coding pens, chip testers, and 3 new ePhone Epic x3’s, the newest style!! He told me to have fun, and I could give any extra passes to anybody I felt like. I asked if I could eat lunch in the cafeteria today, and he agreed then left the room.</p>
    <p>I Put the materials in my locker, then went to lunch with Axel, Cruz, and Abagail. Axel is a serious gamer, and he is amazing at cooking. Cruz is the sports junkie, and all the girls are continuously all over him like flies on a fresh piece of honeycomb. And Abby is a fashion dork, and one of the most popular girls in school. And they were all my best friends. Cruz’s hair is dirty blonde, and he always were the blue and white school baseball hat. Axel is a red head with freckles all over his body, and usually had the school themed beanie on. Abby has blue hair, usually tied up in a ponytail by a white fluffy scrunchie. I have naturally blonde hair, with some freckles on my face, and a birth mark that looks like a heart on my left cheek. The four of us were always together. The three of them were friends since kindergarten, but when I move to Skyline Hills in the second grade, they took a liking to me, and it has been the four of us ever since. They were like the popular kids, except a lot nicer.</p>
    <p>I told them about the privileges Mr. Bennett gave me, and they were stoked. Abby said that it is because I'm the smartest kid in the whole school. Axel agreed, and Cruz was ecstatic to get away from the mob scene of girls at lunch time. Then Samantha showed up. I hated Samantha so much. She always was trying to push me out of the way and one up me in any way possible. I put my head phones on to just ignore her, but she wanted to talk to me, which was weird because I was used to her pushing me out of the conversation, and take the spotlight in every situation. She started talking about how she was going to move, and wanted to have me come to her going away party. “No, thanks.” and I left it there. She gave me an address card anyways and left. It was the classic Jump Palace invite, but there was a small note on the back that said something I'll never forget. “Help me. Find him.”</p>
    <p>I never got to make it to her going away party, because she died the next day. The news said it was an accidental death, she was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and got stabbed in the head by a construction pole that fell because the inspector wasn’t paying attention. I knew it wasn't that simple. Deep down I knew it was him. Whoever ‘He’ was, was dangerous. Killing a first-year student in high school for no clear reason?? I went into a deep spiral of mental pressure for about three months between Samantha’s death and the super chip that I finally broke. I tried to hang myself on New Year's Eve, but my grandmother got home early that day. I told her what was on my mind, including the note. We took a week-long vacation, and went to Akimura, a fun popular town north west of Skyline. It relieved a lot of stress, and then I went back to school on Monday. I forgot to tell Abby, Cruz, and Axel where I went, and they thought that I had died. Everything was fine, until February 3, when Mr. Bennett went missing.</p>
    <p>As we woke up, Zeke was looking at me with Mango in his hand, giggling and trying to be quiet. I peeked my eye open and then scooped him up and started tickling him, which woke up Nate, and he started tickling me. I put Zeke down and ran outside, followed by Nate. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw him, and about six other men, very indistinguishable scents. I saw Zeke and Nate start to come out, and I put my hand up and said go inside, as they went inside, I darted in-between tranquilizers and actual bullets crisscrossing across the trees and the sound echoed through the forest unsettling many animals and making everybody alert. Just as I made it through the door, the last bullet flew just before my face. I told them all to go down to the secret bunker and take Mango. I didn’t want to involve them in this, but I still did. I started gathering my stuff and grabbed the green truck that was left on the floor. I ran down after then locking the door and shutting it down. The last couple of weeks we have been gathering materials to upgrade this space, and it leads all the way to the next two cities over. I used my super to rewrite the code that puts limiters and trackers, making my phone untraceable, unlocked, and gets unlimited free WIFI yesterday. I am going to try and talk to my grandmother and Abby. I stayed behind for a little so I could see if it works. I heard them throwing everything around walking above me. Then they gave up and went outside again. I then quietly ran away to catch up with the others. The waited at the first fork. </p>
    <p>There were about 33 houses that were marked that agreed to take us in along the way to Kamakura. We found a map of the entire route and all the minor tunnels that have off trails. Apparently, it was part of a secret society a long time ago. It was for protecting people, but we didn’t know what kind of people. We found a book, and it said to follow the red line on the map, to the garden located about 3 blocks south. It said nobody that was allowed in could get in, so we hoped it would let us in. When we turned around to go south, Zeke started to cry. I asked him what was wrong, and he said he left his car. I remembered stuffing it in my bag, and a smile grew across my freckled face. He looked confused, but then I reached into my bag, and pulled out the little green car. We made the car from wood scraps and old broken toy cars, just me and him. We were left alone a lot, so we always were together. We started to walk again. Nate grabbed most of the reserves and some useful things, everybody had full bags. I had a half full bag, so to help I gave Zeke a juice pouch and put him on my back. We walk a little, then we checked that map to figure out if we were going the right way. The map said the ladder should be on the side of the wall to the left. We walked a little further, and sure enough, it was there. We walked over to it, and Michael opened it. He was a rather more reserved person around me. As he pushed up the small door, light came pouring in.</p>
    <p>As we crawled out of the whole, we were greeted by flowers and trees. But once we had a closer look, there were animals too. All intrigued, coming towards us. Foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, deer, otters, porcupines, and hedgehogs, just to name a few. I could hear them, most of them just asking who we were, then mango popped out and landed on the floor, which scared the smaller vermin at first, but they soon realized he was harmless. Soon after there was a short lady, whom I assumed asserted her dominance over the other animals. She had a deer like complexion. She has an aura around her, it is calming. She has an overwhelming presence that could draw in anything like bees to an aromatic flower. She looked at me immediately, staring at me, intimately. “Stay caught up, you don’t want to be out here at night,” she said in a soothing voice. We all followed. She led us to a large cottage. It had a light blue paint coat, and there were beautiful plants and flowers everywhere. The path leading to the doorstep of the cottage was paved with flat blue-grey river rocks. It was so beautiful, and I loved it. It felt so, homey. Like I belonged here. I had a feeling drawing me closer, almost like I didn’t have control over my heart.</p>
    <p>That night, the nice lady cooked us a stew. It was absolutely delicious. I could tell there were flavors fresher than anything I had ever tasted. I learned the lady’s name was Amoura. We each got our own rooms. Amoura offered us homemade alcohol. I refused but the boys other than Nate took their privilege to the drink. We all went to bed at about ten o'clock that night, but when I woke up the next morning, one of the boys was missing. I’m pretty sure it was Cameron. I went outside and to my horror, I saw him lying gashed and dead in a bush about twenty-five yards away. The lady was behind me, and when she spoke, it scared me. “I told you to not be caught up in the nighttime out here, didn’t I?” ‘SHIITT!!’ I asked her what had attacked him, and she said a monster called Jacent. It looks like a terrifying creepy pasta from the internet. She asked me to get rid of the corpse before the rest of my group wakes up. I said sure, even though the thought of touching a dead body wasn’t on my to-do list. I took him up the hill to a cave I thought nothing but wild animals would find. I made a semi-burial ground and put him in the cave. Some curious animals came to see what I was doing. They soon lost interest and walked off. When I walked back, I spotted a deer, sort of limping about, and go behind a bush. I decided to follow it.</p>
