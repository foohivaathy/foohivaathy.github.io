	<h1>Tree people and poop</h1>
	<p>Trees are like human people so I sometimes call them people. They cry like human people when you hurt them and shed white or orange tears that smell funny (and is sticky).</p>
	<p>Animals are like human people too so I also sometimes call them people. I'm one of the human people; more commonly called a &quot;person&quot;.</p>
	<p>Tree people are alive, breath, move (in one place) and grow the same as animal people, but human people kill, mutilate and eat tree people all the time. They do the same to the animal people too, but no one seems to care about eating the tree people.</p>
	<p>I haven't really thought about it much. I don't like to eat a lot of green tree people (especially broccoli people), but I haven't had a problem eating other tree people.</p>
	<p>Human people who don't like to eat animal people kill tree people too.</p>
	<p>In fact, human people who don't eat animal people kill more tree people because they still like to be alive. And being alive means you have to eat things and poop. Everything poops. Honey is bee people poop and we eat it.</p>
	<p>Some human people don't like to or can't poop indoors so they poop outdoors where the tree people live so it's like eating them and feeding them back to their own kind.</p>
	<p>Human people who eat animal people poop too and the tree people eat the poop and the human people and animal people eat the tree people again. That means the human people and animal people their own poop by proxy.</p>
	<p>That's pretty messed up.</p>
	<small>(Honey is actually in the bee people's stomach in a part just for honey, which makes it a kind of vomit.)</small>
