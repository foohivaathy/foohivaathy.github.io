	<h1>Farming time</h1>
	<p>I keep running out of time a lot. I always try to find some wherever I can, but it's very good at hiding in places like work and the web. I thought I could find some time on the web, but sometimes I didn't have time to find time.</p>
	<p>The web is built by spiders.</p>
	<p>There were times where I tried to make time, but I couldn't find time to get the ingredients. Looking on the web for ingredients was leading to more and more lost time.</p>
	<p>It evaporates quickly like pouring alcohol on a hot pan. Alcohol leads to a lot of lost time too, but some people enjoy losing time like that. I had a beer the other day. It didn't taste that great and my head spun. Beer is stupid.</p>
	<p>I then tried to grow some time, but that involved using more time... which I couldn't find much of in the first place. Growing time is harder than growing a bonsai. You can only prune what you can do, but what you can do never comes back.</p>
	<p>Time is a plant that grows backwards.</p>
	<small>I've been told I'll like beer if I drink more of it, but I don't have time for that.</small>
